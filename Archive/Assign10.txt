#1 implement a code to determine an interpolating polynomial given a data set:

in two steps:
	a) resuable code to compute the different table and return the 
	coefficients of the Newton Form

	b) reusable code for evaluation of the polynomial at a vector
	of points not in the data set. 

#2. Google Richardson's Problem on interpolation and test your code on this.
