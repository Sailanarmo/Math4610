1. Implement an OpenMP version of a Matrix-Vector Multiplication that runs "faster" than
the sequential version.
	- Plot of the timing as a function of matrix sync (mxn)*(n*1)
2. Implement an OpenMP version of matrix multiplication. (mxn)(nxr)
3. Implement the LU-Factorization with scaled partial pivoting instead of partial pivoting. Make sure this is efficient.

	for(int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
	{
		
	}
4. Use Code from #3 to compute solutions of the linear systems posted.
