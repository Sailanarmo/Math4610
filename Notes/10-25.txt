Compare Methods: Ax = b

Direct Methods:
	
	LU - Factorization + forward sub & back sub
		- Pivoting Strategy
	Cholesky Factorization + forward sub & back sub
	
		A = GG^T
	
Iterative Methods:
	
	Jacobi Iteration
	Gauss-Feidel

Direct Methods		Pros				Cons
					We can count		May not work if K(A)>>1
					the number of			K(A) = ||A||*||A^-1||
					operations

					Implement			Preconditioning is harder
					pivoting			to do

					LS-Cholesky


Iterative Methods	Pros				Cons
					Theses are easier   The equence of approximation
					to implement        may not converge
					
					Easier to code		

					We don't destroy
					A

					Preconditioning
					is easier
