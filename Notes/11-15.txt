Polynomial Interpolation
	
	Monomial Basis is given by {\phi_j(x) = x^j}_j=0^n

This results in the vandermonde system which is usually ill-conditioned.

We can turn to the langrange form of the interpolating polynomial
by using the cardinal/basis functions

	p_n(x) = \sum_j=0^n y_iL_j(x)

	where

	L_j(x) = { 0 i != j
			   1 i= j  }  = \delta_{i,j}

Alg:

	Lagrange Form of the Interpolating Polynomial

	1. Construct: Given data {(x_i,y_i)}_i^n compute the barycentric weights
		
		w_j = \frac{1}{\weirdpi_{i!=j}(x_j - x_i)

	and also the quantities w_jy_i for i = 0...n

	2. Evaluation: Given x!=x_i i = 0...n, we can evaluate

		p_n(x) = gross stuff, you should really go back to notetaking by hand

	3. The Newton Form of the Interpolating Polynomial
	
		giantPhi(x) = weirdPi_j=0^j-i(x-x_i) j = 0 ... n
		
		for n data points
			phi_0(x) = 1
			phi_1(x) = (x - x_0)
					.
					.
					.
			phi_j(x) = (x - x_0)(x-x_1)...(x-x_{j-1})
			
		p_n(x) = c_0 + c_1x ... c_nx^n
