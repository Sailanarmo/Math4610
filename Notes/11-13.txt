Chapter 10 Polynomial Interpolation
	
	we want to find "reasonable" functions that can be use to represent some process

	ex: compute
		
		s = \int_0^3 e^{-x^2}dx , there is no closed form anti derivative for e^{-x^2}

	Instead of using f(x) = e^{-x^2}
	we will use a taylor series expansion

Def: A function y = f(x) is said to interpolate a data set {(x_i,y_i)}_i=0^n if
	y_i = f(x_i)

for i = 0...n

	ex: n = 10

Whi is this important?

	1. We need an approximation function that provides the values of the data
	
	2. If we have an initial value problem or boundary value problem
		
		IVP, y(t_0) = y_0,y'(t_0)=y_0'
		BVP, y(x_0) = y_0, y(x_0) = y_1

	3. Finite Element Analysis

Def: Suppose v(x) is some function that approximates another function f(x). v(x) ~ f(x)
We say that v(x) is an interpolating function if
	v(x_i) = f(x_i)
	i = 0 .. n

If v(x) is in a function space defined by span {\phi_0...\phi_n)
We can write
	
	v(x) = c_0\phi_0(x) + ... + c_n\phi_n(x) = \sum_j=0^n c_j\phi_j(x)

then we can determine the approximation by the coefficients c_j.

If v(x) must interpolate data points

	{(x_i,f(x_i)}_i=0^n = {(x_i,y_i)}_i=0^n

then this means 
	
	v(x_0) = c_0\phi_0(x_0) + ... + c_n\phi_n(x_0) = y_0 
	v(x_1) = c_0\phi_0(x_1) + ... + c_n\phi_n(x_1) = y_1
	                        .
							.
							.
	v(x_n) = c_0\phi_0(x_n) + ... + c_n\phi_n(x_n) = y_n 

Monomial Interpolation:
	
	\phi_j(x) = x^j

Vandermonde Matrix
	
	Fact: If x_0...x_n are distinct real numbers, then the Vandermonde Matrix is invertible.
	This implies a unique solution c_0, ... , c_n exists.

Theorem: For any real data {(x_i,y_i)}_i=0^n with distinct abscissa, x_i, there exists 
a unique polynomial of degree at most n that satisfies the interpolation condition:

	p(x_i) = y_i

	i = 0..n and 
	
	p(x) = \sum_j=1^n c_jx^j
