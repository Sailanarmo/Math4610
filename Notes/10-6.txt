Ax = b
	-> A = LU

Scaled partial pivoting
	
	Initialization

		s_i = max|a_{ij}
		      i <= j <= n
		
		\frac{|a_{q,k}|}{s_q} = max \frac{|a_{q,k}}{s_q}
							k <= p <= n


	Use an integer map for the permutations
		
		for k =1 : n-1
			choose a point
			interchange two integers
			for i = k+1:n
				for j = k+1:n

		Start:
			p = {1,2,3, ... ,n}
			P{k}

	LU-Factorization Ax=b
	Cholesky Factorization: If A is symmetric and positive definite we can factor A into
		A = LDL^T = RR^T = X^TX
	Where
		L is Lower Triangular    R is lower triangular
		D is Diagonal		     and D has been absorbed
							     into R.

	k_p(A) = ||A||_p*||A^{-1}||_p
	
	If K_p(A) ~ 1, then A is said to be a well-conditioned matrix.
	If k_p(A) >> 1, then the matrix is ill-conditioned
